# Responsive Notes Application

This is a simple responsive notes application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The notes are displayed in two columns on larger screens 
and merge into a single column on smaller screens. The application also saves notes to the browser's local storage, ensuring that notes persist even after 
the page is refreshed.

## Features

- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes
- Notes are saved in local storage
- Responsive layout: two columns on larger screens, one column on smaller screens

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser that supports modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Create Notes" button to create a new note.
3. Click inside the note to edit its content. The notes are contenteditable, so you can type directly into them.
4. Click the delete icon (trash can) inside a note to delete it.
5. Notes are automatically saved to local storage, so they will persist even after refreshing the page.
